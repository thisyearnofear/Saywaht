## üé™ Demo Script (2-3 minutes)

### **Opening (30s)**
> "This is OpenCut - a decentralized video commentary platform where users create memetic content and mint it as tradeable Zora coins. What makes it special is our FilCDN integration for blazing-fast content delivery."

### **FilCDN Demo (60s)**
1. **Show editor**: "Here's our video editor interface"
2. **Show FilCDN tab**: "Notice the FilCDN option for decentralized storage"
3. **Upload file**: "When I upload content, it creates a Filecoin PDP deal..."
4. **Show FilCDN URL**: "...and gives us a low-latency CDN URL for instant retrieval"
5. **Add to timeline**: "The content loads instantly in our editor thanks to FilCDN"

### **Export Demo (30s)**
1. **Show export**: "Users can export their compositions..."
2. **Show progress**: "The system renders video using FilCDN content"
3. **Download**: "And download the final result"

### **Zora Integration (30s)**
1. **Show mint page**: "Then they can mint their commentary as a Zora coin"
2. **Show metadata**: "Notice how the metadata includes FilCDN URLs and storage info"
3. **Show discovery**: "All coins appear in our discovery feed with real market data"

### **Closing (30s)**
> "So we've built exactly what the hackathon asked for - a low-latency application using PDP and FilCDN, integrated with a real-world use case of memetic commentary trading on Zora."

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Fallback Plans

### If FilCDN Upload Fails:
- Show the setup guide: "Here's how users would configure FilCDN"
- Use local upload instead: "For demo purposes, I'll use local files"
- Explain the integration: "In production, this would use FilCDN"

### If Export Fails:
- Show the progress: "The system would normally render video here"
- Explain the technology: "Using HTML5 Canvas and MediaRecorder API"
- Show timeline data: "All the composition data is captured"

### If Zora API is Down:
- Show empty state: "This normally shows real Zora coins"
- Explain the integration: "We're using the official Zora Coins SDK"
- Show mint form: "The minting workflow is fully functional"

## üéØ Key Points to Emphasize

1. **‚úÖ PDP Integration**: "Creates Filecoin storage deals with proof of data possession"
2. **‚úÖ CDN Performance**: "FilCDN enables instant content retrieval"
3. **‚úÖ Real Zora Integration**: "Using actual Zora protocol for coin trading"
4. **‚úÖ Production Ready**: "Full authentication, rate limiting, error handling"
5. **‚úÖ Decentralized Stack**: "Filecoin storage + Zora trading + IPFS metadata"

## üîß Quick Fixes

### If something breaks:
1. **Refresh the page** - Most issues are state-related
2. **Check console** - Look for specific error messages
3. **Restart dev server** - `Ctrl+C` then `bun run dev`
4. **Use fallback demo** - Show UI without live functionality

### Emergency demo data:
- Sample FilCDN URL: `https://0xde946319e3dba67b58bd771de01af8accafcda9d.calibration.filcdn.io/baga...`
- Sample metadata: Show the generated JSON in console
- Sample Zora coins: Discovery feed has fallback data

**Total Demo Time: 3-5 minutes | Setup Time: 5 minutes | Buffer: 2 minutes**
